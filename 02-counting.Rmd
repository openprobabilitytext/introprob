# Fundamentals of Probability and Its Axioms

## Combinations and Permutations
Counting plays a very important role in probability. In probability, we often deal with sets, and counting methods such as combinations and permutations help us find the number of elements in a set. Specifically, in probability, we deal with a set called the **sample space** which is the set of all possible outcomes of some random experiment and **events**, which are subsets of the sample space. Typically, the sample space is denoted by $S$ or $\Omega.$ Consider the following example:

**Example 1.1.**
Suppose a fair coin is flipped twice.What is the probability of flipping at least one head?
