# Fundamentals of Probability and Its Axioms

## Combinations and Permutations
Counting plays a very important role in probability. In probability, we often deal with sets, and counting methods such as combinations and permutations help us find the number of elements in a set. Specifically, in probability, we deal with a set called the **sample space** which is the set of all possible outcomes of some random experiment and **events**, which are subsets of the sample space. Typically, the sample space is denoted by $S$ or $\Omega.$ Consider the following example:

**Example 1.1.**
Suppose a fair coin is flipped twice.What is the probability of flipping at least one head?

**Solution**
The sample space of this experiment can expressed as $S=\{HH,HT,TH,TT\}$. Now, consider the event:
$$A=\{\text{At least one outcome is a head}\}$$
Notice that $A\subset S$ ($A$ is a subset of $S$). Since $A=\{HH,HT,TH\},$ we can find the probability as follows:
$$P(A)= \frac{\#\text{elements in A}}{\#\text{elements in S}}=\frac{3}{4}.$$
