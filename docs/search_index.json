In probability, we often deal with sets, and counting methods such as combinations and permutations help us find the number of elements in a set. Specifically, in probability, we deal with a set called the sample space which is the set of all possible outcomes of some random experiment and events, which are subsets of the sample space. Typically, the sample space is denoted by \\(S\\) or \\(\\Omega.\\) Consider the following example: Example 1.1. Suppose a fair coin is flipped twice.What is the probability of flipping at least one head?
